## Definition

Let us consider a hash function $H: \bits^* \to \bits^n$.

We say that $H$ is puzzle friendly if for every possible n-bit output value $y$, if $k$ is chosen from a distribution with high min-entropy, then it is infeasible to find $x$ such that $H(k \|\| x) = y$ in time significantly less than $2^n$.
