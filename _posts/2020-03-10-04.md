## (Strongly) OWF

A function $f:\bits^* \to \bits^* $ is a (strongly) one-way function if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm $F$ mapping $x$ to $f(x)$, $\forall x \in \\{0, 1\\}^*$, and it holds that for every PPT algorithm $A$ and every positive polynomial $p(\cdot)$ and sufficiently large $n$'s:

$$ Pr[F(A(y, 1^n)) = y \;|\; y = F(x); \; x \samples \bits^n] \lt \frac{1}{p(n)}$$

### Auxiliary input

The auxiliary input $1^n$ is redundant if, given only $F(x)$, we can generate[^lpf] $1^{\|x\|}$ in time polynomial in $\|x\|$. This auxiliary input prevents a function $f$ to be considered one-way if it only shrinks its input in such a way that, whenever we try to invert, we cannot generate the desired output in polynomial (in the size of the input!) time.

## Weakly OWF

In the weak variant, we only require that any algorithm trying to compute any pre-image of $f(x)$, for a random choice of $x$, fails with (any!) noticeable probability. So we come up with this definition: $f$ is weakly OW if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm $F$ mapping $x$ to $f(x)$, $\forall x \in \bits^*$, and there exists a polynomial $p(\cdot)$ such that for every PPT algorithm $A$ and sufficiently large $n$'s, it holds that:

$$Pr[F(A(y)) = y \;|\; y = F(x); \; x \samples \bits^n] \le 1 - \frac{1}{p(n)}$$

**Note:** It is possible to show that weakly OWF imply the existence of OWF; moreover, since every OW function is also weakly OW, we claim that:

> weakly OWF exist if and only if OWF exist.

However, it should be noticed that not all weakly OW functions are strongly OW too.
