## OWF

A function $F:\\{0, 1\\}^* \to \\{0, 1\\}^* $ is a one-way function if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm mapping $x$ to $F(x)$, $\forall x \in \\{0, 1\\}^*$, and it holds that for every PPT algorithm $A$, $\exists\;\epsilon \in negl(\lambda)$ such that

$$Pr[F(A(y)) = y | y = F(x); x \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^*] \lt \epsilon(\lambda)$$

## Weak OWF

In the weak variant, we only require that any algorithm trying to compute any pre-image of $F(x)$, for a random choice of $x$, fails with probability larger than 90%. So we come up with this definition: $F$ is weak OWF if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm mapping $x$ to $F(x)$, $\forall x \in \\{0, 1\\}^*$, and it holds that for every PPT algorithm $A$

$$Pr[F(A(y)) = y | y = F(x); x \leftarrow \{0, 1\}^*] \lt 0.1$$

**Note:** It is possible to show that wOWF and OWF are equivalent.
