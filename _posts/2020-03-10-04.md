## (Strongly) OWF

A function $f:\bits^* \to \bits^* $ is a (strongly) one-way function if it is [polynomial-time computable]({% post_url 2020-03-13-05 %}) and it holds that for every PPT algorithm $A$ and every positive polynomial $p(\cdot)$ and sufficiently large $n$'s:

$$ Pr[f(A(y, 1^n)) = y \;|\; y = f(x); \; x \samples \bits^n] < \frac{1}{p(n)}$$

### Auxiliary input

The auxiliary input $1^n$ is redundant if, given only $F(x)$, we can generate[^lpf] $1^{\|x\|}$ in time polynomial in $\|x\|$. This auxiliary input prevents a function $f$ to be considered one-way if it only shrinks its input in such a way that, whenever we try to invert, we cannot generate the desired output in polynomial (in the size of the input!) time.

## Weakly (or somewhat) OWF

In the weak variant, we only require that any algorithm trying to compute any pre-image of $f(x)$, for a random choice of $x$, fails with (any!) noticeable probability. So we come up with this definition: a polynomial-time computable function $f$ is weakly one-way if there exists a polynomial $p(\cdot)$ such that for every PPT algorithm $A$ and sufficiently large $n$'s, it holds that:

$$Pr[f(A(y)) = y \;|\; y = f(x); \; x \samples \bits^n] \le 1 - \frac{1}{p(n)}$$

## Strongly vs Weakly

It is possible to show that weakly one-way functions imply the existence of strongly ones; moreover, since every OW function is also weakly OW, we claim that:

> weakly OWF exist if and only if OWF exist.

However, it should be noticed that [not all weakly one-way functions are strongly one-way too]({% post_url 2020-03-14-06 %}).

## The other side of the moon

In the following alternative definition we lower-bound (to $\rho$) the failure probability of all PPT algorithms trying to invert $f$.

So, a polynomial-time computable function $f$ is $\rho$-one-way if for all PPT algorithms $A$, for sufficiently large $n$'s it holds that:

$$Pr[f(A(y) \ne y \;|\; y = f(x); \; x \samples \bits^n] > \rho(n)$$

This means that:

- a weakly OW function $f$ is a $\frac{1}{p}$-one-way, for some $p$
- a (strongly) OW function $f$ is ($1-\epsilon$)-one-way, where $\epsilon$ is negligible
