description: A simple proof to show that El Gamal encryption scheme is not CCA-secure.
---
This is one of the exercises proposed by Katz and Lindell[^1].

## Solution
Given and El Gamal encryption scheme with publick key $pk = (\mathbb{G}, q, g, h=g^\alpha)$, the challenge ciphertext $c_b = (c_1, c_2)$, with $c_1 = g^r$ and $c_2 = h^r \cdot m_b$, the attacker asks to decrypt $m = (c_1, c_2 \cdot k)$, for some message $k$ of its choice: this property is called *malleability*.
Then it easily retrieves $m_b = \frac{m}{k}$.
