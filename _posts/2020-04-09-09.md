## Definition

Let us consider a private-key encryption scheme $\Pi = (\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$.

We define the encryption range $ \textrm{Range}_n(k) = \\{ \Enc_k(x) \| x \in \bits^n \\} $ the set of all the possible ciphertexts that can be obtained with a given key $k$.

### Elusive range

$\Pi$ has an elusive range if forall PPT adversaries A, all polynomial $p$ and sufficiently large $n$'s, it holds that:

$$Pr[\textrm{A}(1^n) \in \textrm{Range}_n(k) | k \samples \Gen(1^n)] \le \frac{1}{p(n)} $$

Intuitively, if a scheme has such a property, it is computationally hard for an attacker to generate a valid ciphertext: i.e. $\Dec_k(c_i) = \bot$ for most of the ciphertext $c_i$ that an attacker can produce (without knowing the key, of course).

### Efficiently verifiable range

$\Pi$ has an efficiently verifiable range if $\exists$ PPT $\textrm{V}$ such that $\textrm{V}(1^n, k, c) = 1$ if and only if $c \in \textrm{Range}_n(k)$.
